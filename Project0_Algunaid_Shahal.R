#     Call the loaded data titanic.

# 2.1 How many rows are in the data frame? 
  nrow(titanic2)
  #Answer: 14
  
# 2.2 How many columns? 
  ncol(titanic2)
  # Answer: 5
  
# 2.3 What do the rows and columns represent?
  #     Answer: Each row represents class of passenger or crew,
  #             Each column represents a characteristic
  #             for each passenger, which include the
  #             characteristics Clas, Sex, Age, Survived, Died.  
  
# 3.1 Select the 1st, 5th, and 10th rows with
  #columns Class and Age.  
  titanic2[c(1,5,10),c("Class", "Age")]
  
  
# 4.1 Regress Survived and Died on the predictors Class, Sex and Age
  #using the two-column form for the dependent variable.  
  fit <- glm(cbind(Survived, Died) ~ Class + Sex + Age, family=binomial,  data=titanic2)
  summary(fit) 
  
# 4.2 Are any of the predictors associated with survival?
  # Answer: AgeChild is positively associated with survival.
  # Class2nd, Class3rd, ClassCrew and SexMale are
  # all negatively associated with survival.
  
# 4.3 If so, explain the relationship based on the t-statistics.
  # Answer: The t-statistics for AgeChild, Class2nd, Class3rd, ClassCrew
  # and SexMale are all well below the significance threshold
  # of 0.05.  
  
  
# 4.4 Explain the chances of survival in terms of odds, giving the 
  # precise numbers and giving in terms a non-expert can understand.
  odds <- exp(fit$coefficients)[-1]

  #  Class2nd   Class3rd  ClassCrew    SexMale   AgeChild 
  # 0.3612825  0.1690159  0.4241466  0.3459219 11.2465380

  # rate of 1 in 3. If you are in Third Class, the odds of your

  # are a child, the odds of your survival are better than
  # 11 to 1.
